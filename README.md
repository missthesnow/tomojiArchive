[!NOTE]
> The archived chats are categorized as they were organized originally on the server with subcategories for the Main Campus, Darkwick Houses, and Social Media. Additionally, I exported some informational channels that I will make available once I have ensured there is no personal information contained within them.

### Disclaimers
> [!WARNING]
> Due to many of the source channels being deleted by the server owner/mods, many of the images linked in this archive are no longer functioning. I will be updating these as I am able. If you notice a missing image and happen to have the image on hand, you are welcome to send it to me and I will get it uploaded.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some archived chats are from individuals that have been retconned out of preferred canon or had their names changed. They are preserved here to provide context for the overall archived story. (i.e. Seiya, Jo, Goro, etc.)

### Viewing the Archive

> [!TIP]
> The archive can be viewed in its raw format on GitHub, but is best viewed via the GitHub Pages deployment using a desktop web browser.
