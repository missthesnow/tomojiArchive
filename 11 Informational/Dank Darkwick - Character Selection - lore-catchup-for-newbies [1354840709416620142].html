Milo:
<ul><li>Popular streamer, originally an anonymous Vtuber. Showed his face before coming to Darkwick because he was pretty sure Leo planned to dox him.</li><li>Hates Leo. They both take shots at eachother online, but they&#39;re temporarily cordial for monetary reasons. </li><li>From German branch. Originally temporarily at Darkwick to get a feel for it, but he&#39;s staying now.</li></ul>
Ken: 
<ul><li>Boy Failure. No Rizz. Incel. </li><li>Loves Haru and helping around Jabberwock, but always manages to make it worse. Haru wants him to stop helping.</li><li>Mumei recently ruined his life by telling Ren about Ken&#39;s gross habit of making the people he likes in Sims and impregnating them. Ren deleted his Sims game, so he hates Ren now too.</li><li>Ren and him used to play video games before.</li><li>His main goal in life is to &quot;cultivate his harem&quot;, despite his inability to communicate with the people that he thinks are pretty. </li><li>Will leave gifts at your door if he thinks you&#39;re pretty.</li><li>Hates guys that are a threat to his harem.  Traditionally handsome, socially integrated. If they are either of these things and like the people he does, they&#39;re deemed a &quot;chad&quot; or &quot;gigachad&quot;. </li><li>Also hates Leo.</li></ul>
Leo: 
<ul><li>Used to be kind of cordial with Zero. They&#39;ve had a few falling outs because Leo&#39;s an asshole. They&#39;re okay-ish now.</li><li>Leo tracks Zero. He used to track Seiya, until he got rid of his old phone. Leo will probably do it again here soon.</li><li>When Zero and Seiya used to date, he made bets with people on the downfall of their breakup. For no reason other than he just wanted money and thought it would happen. </li><li>Had an enemies turned to kind of chill arc with Kamiyama/Tomosei. </li><li>Told Seiya they were dating when he got amnesia as a prank. He let it go on too long and humiliated Seiya. Lowkey feels bad about it. </li><li>Kissed Seiya twice.</li><li>Was kidnapped by Chi at one point because Chi had a crush on him. Chi almost did a murder suicide in the name of love. (Do not bring this up to Chi, he doesn&#39;t remember it and will jump.)</li><li>Has a crush on Seiya, but shows it in the form of bullying. Slowly changing. </li><li>Banged Jo once. He&#39;s still salty over her new relationships.</li><li>Cut off Jabberwock&#39;s plumbing for the day because Sterling was flirting with Jo.</li></ul></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Thursday, March 27, 2025 10:58 AM">(edited)</span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=two_hearts><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=💕 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f495.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>5</span></div><div class=chatlog__reaction title=00hkluvloveheart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=00hkluvloveheart src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1071833180845387917.png loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

He&#39;s the main guy I play.</li><li>Likes red bull. Likes making tea blends, Loves playing piano</li><li>Has a stupid powerful stigma, but using it properly and not just for dumb shit is Very taxing on him. He can modify the odds of something happening, and the worse the odds, the worse the stigma use affects him. In addition, repeated stigma use causes compounding issues.</li><li>Leo - Chill. Hated him. Chill again. It fluctuates but Zero is learning that Leo is just Leo.</li><li>Jo Waker - best friend, but it has been ROCKY. They&#39;re ok rn though. Jo kissed him and Zero tried to use his stigma to kiss her back and make it so that she&#39;d be disgusted by it. Sort of backfired. But they&#39;re ok now</li><li>Chihiro Mori - Zero loves this guy. Would kill for this guy. Literally. Only this guy.</li><li>Seiya Masamoto - Dated him for a bit. Convinced himself that Seiya would hate him/hated him for his pre-darkwick background as a gun for hire. Started falling out of affection for him as he got closer to Kamiyama.</li><li>Via some body-swap fuckery, he gets to meet Kamiyama. Sees a lot of himself in Kamiyama. Gets attached and starts trying to look out for him because he thinks Kamiyama is probably a lonely guy. Kamiyama makes it clear he does NOT give a shit about Zero. But Zero persists.</li><li>Zero is tutored by Tomosei Himeji. During a tutoring session, Zero talks to Tomosei about if he&#39;s seen a guy that looks like Kamiyama but doesn&#39;t mention him by name. Tomosei Slips up mentioning a detail that Kamiyama would know but <em>Tomosei</em> shouldn&#39;t. Zero connects the dots and is relieved that Kamiyama/Tomosei is ok (bc he&#39;s right there). He insists he is going to keep being kind to Kamiyama</li><li>During the study session it is revealed that Zero struggles with reading. Tomosei learns this fact. Kamiyama reveals it online in an attempt to humiliate Zero and get him to fuck off. Zero is hurt but justifies that Kamiyama would only do something like that if he was also deeply hurting. He continues to be kind to Kamiyama. Goes so far to say that he prefers Kamiyama over the Tomosei Princess. This infuriates the living hell out of Kamiyama. He tells Zero to come to his room so he can use his stigma to listen to Zero&#39;s thoughts and see if he&#39;s full of shit. Zero is not, in fact, full of shit. He is so not full of shit, in fact, that for the first time since coming to Darkwick, he fully uses his stigma to change the odds that Kamiyama will believe &quot;He (Kamiyama) is not nothing.&quot; This sort-of incapacitates Zero. We also learn that Zero&#39;s reading disability is due to a brain injury and lack of depth perception since he only has one working eye. the other is a prosthetic.</li><li>This results in a strange sort of alliance between Zero and Tomosei, who tells Zero he can call him &#39;Tomo&#39; since Zero doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s right to call him neither Kamiyama nor Tomosei. Zero starts talking to Tomo more, asks for advice about his relationship issues with Seiya.</li><li>A few independent events transpire. Zero thinks he&#39;s ruined a lot of his relationships and spirals. His mental state reaches a breaking point and he uses his stigma over and over to try and lock himself in his room and pass the fuck out. He&#39;s found by Seiya who takes him to the infirmary. He&#39;s out for 6 weeks.</li><li>Post-coma, he tells Seiya everything, including that he&#39;s catching feelings for Kamiyama. Seiya rightfully breaks up with him. He continues to bother Tomo. Eventually they talk a bit more openly about their mutual feelings but don&#39;t really do anything about it. That is until after the Jo Poison episode, Tomo falls asleep in Zero&#39;s arms and before he leaves he kisses (and bites) Zero&#39;s neck.</li><li>After a Mission with Leo, Seiya and Jo, Zero asks out Tomo and then meets up with him. Tomo kisses Zero. Zero kisses Tomo. Later on they go on a date where Tomo refers to Zero as his boyfriend.</li></ul></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=🩷><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=🩷 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1fa77.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>4</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

She blames herself for the event, but it&#39;s also one of those situations where her inaction while terribly injured is not necessarily right or wrong</li><li>The Waker family sucks and they built a shadowy corporate empire selling the diamonds Jo can make with her stigma once she became a ghoul. Would also frequently take out problematic people by turning them to diamond. To expand, they decided to marry Jo off to The Society, some secret gang in Australia that has vast connections (think basically Aussie mafia). It was arranged and everything, and Jo&#39;s cousin had to monitor her when she transferred to Japan to make sure she came back in time for the wedding</li><li>Obviously she didn&#39;t</li><li>So a plot where Jo, even while disguised as another student, gets kidnapped ensues and she&#39;s hauled onto a ship that Leo, Zero, and Seiya rescue her from. After these events, Jo manages to successfully cut off her family <s>and kill her cousin</s></li><li>Jo has a mega-cursed love life idk what to tell you, it&#39;s be too much to explain rn</li><li>Besties with Zero, it has been Difficult though but they&#39;re coming good now</li><li>Grey area in her friendship with Seiya, for how close they once were, they now seem a lot closer and yet more frequently at odds</li><li>Jo holds deeply affectionate and romantic feelings for Leo. There was almost a kind of courtship going on from her side, though she&#39;d deny it if anyone asked what all the gifts and attention she gave him was about until she confessed to him and, based on his reaction, she thought he didn&#39;t feel the same. After they slept together (it was a fairly charged scene tbf even if Jo was heartbroken), Jo started basically ghosting Leo. She&#39;s resentful about a lot of things now when it comes to him but an echo of her feelings remains</li></ul></span> <span class=chatlog__edited-timestamp title="Saturday, March 29, 2025 9:41 AM">(edited)</span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1355552009146859590 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1355552009146859590><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 29, 2025 9:39 AM">9:39 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><ul><li>Don&#39;t ask her about Saki</li><li>Do not mention Romeo</li><li>Under no circumstances do you bring up Towa or the love spell incident </li><li>The period of time when she was in love with Zero does not exist as far as she&#39;s concerned too</li><li>...don&#39;t bring up Lily, she&#39;ll actually cry</li><li>Jo likes Sterling a hell of a lot, but much remains to be seen for what comes of their mutual feelings</li></ul></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=heart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=❤️ src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/2764.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>2</span></div></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1355552325791518831 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1355552325791518831><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Saturday, March 29, 2025 9:40 AM">9:40 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><ul><li>Beat up Zero&#39;s ex, Ryu, and still kinda wants to beat up Zero&#39;s current bf, Tomo, but for a variety of reasons</li></ul></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=heart_eyes><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=😍 src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/1f60d.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>
