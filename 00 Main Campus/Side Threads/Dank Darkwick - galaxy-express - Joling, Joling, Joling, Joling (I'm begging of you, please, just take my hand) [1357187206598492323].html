She sent Seiya a couple texts on the way, mind running through a dozen things. Good grief, did she even pack her lipstick or just her lip balm? Was it worth going back for if she couldn&#39;t find it in her bag?</em>

<em>Shut up, Waker. She was stressing too much about this. Seiya was probably the most responsible person she knew. And Laurent was naive but not totally clueless. The puppy (Rabbit wasn&#39;t the worst name, she&#39;ll admit, but Jo found herself growing partial to Honey) would nap most of the time and she already set out water and dinner for the little guy.</em>

<em>...if it&#39;s not already clear to the reader, Jo&#39;s stress is misplaced. She&#39;s nervous about the date. This isn&#39;t technically her first, because she took Saki out for dinner once before the infamous Ballroom Incident, and there was that semi-study-date with Lily. And she&#39;d gone out for beach days before with Seiya.</em>

<em>And Sterling had brought her out to that clearing in the anomalous forest with grape juice and a picnic blanket. It had</em> felt <em>like a date, but he seemed hesitant about it coming off as too much. Jo wished she had told him then that it definitely wasn&#39;t too much, that it was beautiful and lovely and something she won&#39;t soon forget.</em>

<em>But there&#39;s more to this one for her. This time, there&#39;s been weeks of romantic tension that finally started to bloom a few days ago. And instead of running away like she had with Lily and technically had with Leo too, Jo stayed. And told Sterling she&#39;s not arguing if anyone calls her his girl. He said he&#39;s not bothered by that. What the hell are they then? Is it too soon? How long did it take Zero and Seiya to say they were boyfriends after going on dates? Jo doesn&#39;t know any of this shit.</em>

<em>Jo sinks down onto a bench and takes a breath. This was Sterling. Things would work themselves out.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div>

He’s not nervous. That’s ridiculous. He’s fine. Just checking for train delays. For a train that&#39;s never delayed. Or scouting for shady figures. Or making sure there’s no—hell, ghost pigeons or zipper crocs or whatever the latest anomaly trend was.</em>

<em>Fine. Maybe he’s a little nervous.</em>

<em>But it’s not the bad kind. It’s the sort of nervous that sits under your ribs like fizzy soda, the kind that makes you run a hand through your hair too many times and straighten a shirt that’s already fine. He keeps adjusting the worn denim jacket he threw on over his best clean T-shirt (black, a little fitted, because someone once told him he looked good in black—he’s hoping that someone confirms the theory today).</em>

<em>He glances down at the small paper bag in his hand. Inside: two of the good melonpan rolls from Sho&#39;s truck, and a tiny, hand-carved sea turtle charm he finished late last night. He’d debated giving it to her at all. Maybe it was too much. But then he’d remembered Jo, curled up against him, that rabbit clutched in her palm like it meant something.</em>

<em>And, well. He figured he’d take the gamble. His eyes scan the entrance anyway—and then—There she is.</em>

<em>Jo. In the soft morning light, hair a little wild, expression pulled tight with that focused look she gets when her thoughts are chewing themselves alive. She’s beautiful. Of course she is. She could show up in combat boots and a hazmat suit and still make his heart do tricks it shouldn’t be able to. She sinks onto the bench like she’s trying to make herself small.</em>

<em>Sterling’s smile kicks in, warm and crooked, and the fizz in his chest turns into something steady. He walks over, boots scuffing quietly, and eases down beside her with a familiar lean, shoulder just barely brushing hers.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1357369229573361828 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1357369229573361828><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Thursday, April 3, 2025 10:00 AM">10:00 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve>“Hey,” <em>he says, voice low but fond.</em> “You look like you just survived a hurricane of existential dread.”

<em>Sterling deserved a more collected, level-headed Jo Waker. In general, she was a lot tamer around him, which scared her a bit. It was strangely difficult to reach many of the extremes she usually did around others when it comes to the cowboy. Even Seiya could have her lash out.</em>

<em>She&#39;s still not sure what made Sterling different. Maybe she&#39;ll figure it out eventually.</em>

<em>Distantly, she hears the scuff of his boots before she glances up—and there he is. Sterling. Cute curls, blinding smile, and warm gaze. Already, Jo feels lighter in his presence.

<em>For a short while, Jo can relax and trust that Laurent&#39;s in good hands with Seiya. And for the first time in a long time, her cheeks actually ache with smiling.</em>

<em>She talks a bit about the beaches in Australia, explaining how she&#39;s been surfing for years, and it was the one thing Stef was never all that into, which meant Jo had a lot of time to spend relishing the hobby alone.

...

<em>When the train comes to a stop, Jo&#39;s almost disappointed. She could sit here in conversation with Sterling forever.

<em>And Jo didn&#39;t have to play mind games when it came to Sterling. Didn&#39;t have to pretend like she didn&#39;t want him. Didn&#39;t have to guess at his feelings for her. Well, not too much. He clearly seemed to care, and good deal more openly than Leo at that.</em>

<em>A nagging part of her does wonder how seriously Sterling views her though. Would Jo even take herself serious in his shoes, knowing what she does about herself and her past?</em>

<em>Jo pays the rental fee for two surfboards at a kiosk, carefully packing her thoughts away for later. It was a heavy day. She was meant to be enjoying her date, not getting caught in her head every half hour.</em></span></div><div class=chatlog__reactions><div class=chatlog__reaction title=heart><img class="chatlog__emoji chatlog__emoji--small" alt=❤️ src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/twitter/twemoji@latest/assets/svg/2764.svg loading=lazy> <span class=chatlog__reaction-count>1</span></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<em>He sits up, wet and sandy, watching her reach the rental stand. Doesn’t follow just yet. Instead, he exhales slowly and lets the tide kiss his ankles a few more times, giving her space.

Sterling was like a lake with his sparkling surface and surprising depth, and he was warm, charmingly witty, passionate, and jaw-droppingly gorgeous.</em>

<em>The thing is... what Jo&#39;s done time and time again is to gravitate toward the most comfortable situation. The most familiar. What was familiar was uncertainty, instability, one-sidedness, and torture. That was what Leo represented to her. Jo couldn&#39;t read him as well as she could read other people, at least, she doesn&#39;t think she can. Not after she had tried to get him to confess to</em> something <em>and received only dismissals. But then they&#39;d had sex. And everything after that has been a mess of petty communications Jo&#39;s starting to think might have been caused by some misunderstanding she hasn&#39;t yet grasped.</em>

<em>Leo was familiar. She&#39;d known him distantly about as long as she had known Seiya and Zero. And the nature of whatever their relationship was at this point was an easy pattern of insecurity.</em>

<em>She moved on from Lily for that easiness. Jo wonders when she&#39;ll stop feeling guilty and upset and so utterly muddled about Lily leaving without a word. She should have said something. Explained things honestly to her pretty eye in the sky. Maybe Lily would have understood. Jo&#39;s not sure. Lily wasn&#39;t as familiar. She presented unique feelings and problems.</em>

<em>And now it&#39;s the same with Sterling.</em>

<em>He&#39;s... different. Much in the same way Lily was different from everyone else. Things weren&#39;t one-sided, at least they didn&#39;t appear to be. They&#39;re both such warm people. Incredibly caring. Performing acts small and large in service of others. When Jo asks either of them questions, they had been open. Honest. Earnest, even, as if determined to give Jo the answers she sought, unafraid to be known to her in any way that would bring them closer.</em></span></div></div></div></div><div id=chatlog__message-container-1362085388897747075 class=chatlog__message-container data-message-id=1362085388897747075><div class=chatlog__message><div class=chatlog__message-aside><div class=chatlog__short-timestamp title="Wednesday, April 16, 2025 10:21 AM">10:21 AM</div></div><div class=chatlog__message-primary><div class="chatlog__content chatlog__markdown"><span class=chatlog__markdown-preserve><em>It&#39;s frightening to her.

And now Jo worries about it with Sterling. The looks he gives her. The things he does.</em>

<em>More than that, Jo worries about the steady warmth burning like a merry hearth in her heart. What if she&#39;s reading all this wrong and she winds up in love and unrequited again? What happens if it is requited? What if Sterling turned out to be a different person once he knew he had her? What if they wanted different things? What if she was moving too fast? Too slow?

“…You’re lucky I’m into power moves!” <em>he yells, grinning like a fool.</em>
